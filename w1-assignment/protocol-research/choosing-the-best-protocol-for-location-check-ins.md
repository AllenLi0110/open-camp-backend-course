# Choosing the Best Protocol for Location Check-ins: AT Protocol vs. ActivityPub

## Introduction

This document analyzes the AT Protocol as a potential foundation for a new product: a location check-in application, similar to Foursquare/Swarm, featuring GPS coordinates, photos, and a global news feed. This analysis compares the AT Protocol with ActivityPub, examining the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and SWOT of each for the project's needs. It ends with a recommendation to use the AT Protocol, along with potential risks and suggestions.

User needs and expectations for the location check-in application:

1. Users can create a location check-in post with optional GPS coordinates.
2. When posting, users can optionally attach a photo.
3. A global newsfeed displays all user posts (check-ins).

## Overview of AT Protocol & ActivityPub

### AT Protocol

The AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol) is an open standard for decentralized social networking, developed by Bluesky Social PBC. It fix problems in centralized social media and other decentralized protocols by focusing on data portability, user experience, algorithm choice, and scalability. The AT Protocol uses a modular design, separating user identity, data storage, and application logic.

### ActivityPub

ActivityPub is an open, decentralized social networking protocol. It provides a standard for creating, updating, and deleting data using a client-server structure, as well as a server-to-server API for federated communication. ActivityPub uses ActivityStreams 2.0, a JSON-based data format, to represent social interactions like posts and likes. Key parts include Actors (users or groups) and Objects (content or actions). When an Actor performs an action on an Object, it creates an Activity (e.g., "Create," "Follow," or "Like"). Instances (servers) help users communicate by sending/receiving messages between servers.

## AT Protocol vs ActivityPub: Key Differences

### 1. Architecture Design:

AT Protocol: Uses a modular design that separates user identity, data storage, and application logic, emphasizing data portability and algorithm choice.

ActivityPub: Employs a client-server structure focused on federated communication and activity streams.

### 2. Identity Systems:

AT Protocol: Implements a decentralized identity system allowing users to carry their data across different services.

ActivityPub: Identities are typically bound to specific instances (servers).

### 3. Data Models:

AT Protocol: Custom data model tailored for social networking needs.

ActivityPub: Uses ActivityStreams 2.0 (JSON format) to represent social interactions.

### 4. Scalability:

AT Protocol: Designed with scalability and user experience as core goals.

ActivityPub: May face scaling challenges in large-scale deployments.

### 5.Implementation Examples:

AT Protocol: Developed and used by Bluesky.

ActivityPub: Adopted by multiple platforms including Mastodon.

Both are decentralized social networking protocols, but AT Protocol focuses more on user control and portability, while ActivityPub emphasizes standardized federated communication.

## SWOT Analysis

| Feature           | AT Protocol                          | ActivityPub                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Strengths**     | Data Portability, User Control       | Established Community               |
| **Weaknesses**    | Limited Adoption, Scalability Issues | Complexity in Moderation            |
| **Opportunities** | New Market Potential                 | Integration with Existing Platforms |
| **Threats**       | High Competition                     | Centralization Risks                |

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Maturity and Ecosystem

- **Risk**: The AT Protocol's newness may create challenges with tools, libraries, and community support.
- **Mitigation**: Invest in building third-party tools and libraries.

### 2. Adoption

- **Risk**: Limited adoption may affect the network effect and the ability to reach enough users.
- **Mitigation**: Focus on building a great user experience and offering unique features that attract users to our platform.

### 3. Scalability

- **Risk**: Potential scaling issues may occur as the network grows.
- **Mitigation**: Implement good caching and indexing strategies, and optimize our PDS infrastructure performance.

## Recommendation

Considering the needs of our location check-in application, the AT Protocol offers several advantages. While ActivityPub is mature and widely adopted, the AT Protocol's focus on data portability, algorithm choice, and user control aligns more closely with our vision for a user-centered, decentralized social network.

Bluesky has successfully used TypeScript for similar applications, serving as a valuable reference. The AT Protocol's flexibility and modular design enable us to tailor the platform to our specific needs and provide unique features. We can consider exploring open-source projects to gain additional insights into its implementation, which may help inform our development efforts.

## Conclusion

The AT Protocol offers a promising foundation for building decentralized social applications. While challenges remain, its focus on data portability, user control, and scalability make it worth considering. More research and testing are needed to fully assess if it's right for the location check-in application.
